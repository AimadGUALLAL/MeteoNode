During the Web Application Development course, 
I was able to learn to manipulate several tools and use them practically to develop my skills in designing a weather website. 
I relied on the achievements of the tutorials and I decided to go further on the Weather application by adding several options easily adjustable by the user.

The main objective is therefore to allow users to directly choose the city on the map and immediately display 
the weather forecast for the next few days in an intuitive way,while mobilizing the various code points that we were able to see during the course of the week.
The application was designed by building 3 pages: 

A home page where weather information is displayed:

  -The name of the chosen city with its description
  -Its location on the map
  -Weather information for the current day or the next few days
  
A configuration page where the user can play with the parameters:

   -Choose from 3 cities namely Gif-sur-Yvette, Palaiseau, Orsay and Paris
   -Type the name of the city.
   -Browse the Google Maps map and click on the desired city for weather information.
   -Change the temperature units or wind speed.
   -Possibility to hide and choose the information to display.
   -Choose the date and the next days.
   
A contact page.

The website was obviously created using the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Nodejs frame work that I handled well during the course.
To mobilize additional options to the Weather application, I used other services, namely Geocoding API and Google Maps Api. 
These two services would allow us to integrate Google Maps into our application and quickly choose the city on the map with a simple click to view the corresponding information. 
I also deployed the weather forecast using Open Weather.
